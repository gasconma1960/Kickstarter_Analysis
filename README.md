## Kickstarter_Analysis
## Overview of Project
   We want to show Louise’s play how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, using the specif data visualization such as charts and the tables, we will be able to describe it better to Louise’s play they outcomes
### Purpose
    - Provide an accurate overview using the data in excel giving the best suggestion using the chart, tables and pivotables that will be including further down, came out with the results and conclusions

# Overview of Project 
**The purpose of this Project**

   Using all charts and tools that Excel has made easier to understand the complexity of this data for Louise’s play, looking on the Pivotable we were able to create the charts that will help us understand how this Project will be succesfull based on the Launch dates as well as the Goal set for, also when is possible to fail and so on
  
# Analysis and Challenges   

   The screenshot below provide a Descriptive Statistics that will make us understand very important metrics and helps us narrow down a large date into one table. A Goal of $10554 will be set to Fail other than a Goal of $5049 will be Succesful

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   Well, when I have to use the “Goal” column and create the following dollar-amount ranges so projects can be grouped based on their goal amount was the most difficult part, as well using the count(ifs) formulas, then a realize how to overcome trying to use a formula that will facilite the work for me

## Results
# What are some limitations of this dataset? 
  - > The data could be incomplete. Missing values, even the lack of a section or a substantial part of the data, could limit its usability'
  - > Insufficient sample size for statistical measurements'
  - > Lack of previous research studies on the topic'
# Conclusions for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

-  Based on the Launch Date the changes for this Project to be Successful is to be Launch between May and June are the Highest
-  October is the Month for the Launch Date that shows there more changes that launches Fail

# Conclusions for the Outcomes based on Goals

-  Goals that range between 45000 and 49999 will have 100% Failed Outcomes
-  Those Goal set between 100 to 4999 will have 75% Successful Outcomes

For the Outcomes Based on Goal there are many charts, but I really like using Staked Column, it is easier to analyze and provide
